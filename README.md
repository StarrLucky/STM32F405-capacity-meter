# STM32F405RTG6_board_CAPmeter
Using t=R*C formula.

UNFINISHED.

This simple method is kinda frustrating and can be used just for fun and rough estimate of capacity. 
In future version, hopefully, I will use more complex schematic with  freq. measurnent methods (despite it is easier to just buy professional meter)
